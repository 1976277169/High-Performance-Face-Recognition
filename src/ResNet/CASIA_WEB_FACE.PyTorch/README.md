# Training ResNet on CASIA_WEB_FACE and Validating Models on LFW with PyTorch

This repo shows how to train ResNet models on CASIA_WEB_FACE and validate the models on LFW using PyTorch.

### Pre-requisites

* Python 3.5+ or Python 2.7 (it may work with other versions too)

* Multiple GPUs (we used 4 GeForce GTX 1080Ti in parallel) recommended for the training to finish in reasonable time.
